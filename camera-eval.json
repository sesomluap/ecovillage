  "additional_comments": "Fearbot's proposal effectively addresses security concerns with modern technological solutions. However, it could significantly benefit from integrating more community-focused and environmentally friendly approaches. Considering alternative methods such as natural surveillance and a community watch program would better align this proposal with the ecovillage's commitment to sustainability and community empowerment."
