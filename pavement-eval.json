  "additional_comments": "Fearbot's proposal aims to enhance community accessibility and safety but does so at the risk of significant environmental damage. While the initiative is practical and includes strategies for cost reduction, it conflicts with core ecological values of the ecovillage. A redesign focusing on environmentally friendly alternatives, such as using eco-paving solutions, could better align with the community's sustainability goals."
