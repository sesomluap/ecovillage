  "additional_comments": "Elayne's proposal for a community greenhouse is a well-thought-out initiative that aligns with the community's values of sustainability, education, and interdependence. The proposal effectively utilizes the greenhouse not just as a means to extend the growing season, but also as a center for community education and engagement. Consideration of more environmentally low-impact technologies and practices could further strengthen the proposal."
